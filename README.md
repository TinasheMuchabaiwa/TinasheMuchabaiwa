# Hi, I'm Tinashe 👋

  **Senior Backend Engineer** building systems that work in challenging environments.

  ## About Me
  7 years deep in backend engineering, from junior dev in Harare to senior roles across Toronto, Oslo, and
  Seattle. I've learned that great engineering is about preventing problems, making smart trade-offs, and
  building systems that actually work for real people.

  Currently applying everything I've learned to build scalable systems in challenging environments.

  ## What I Build
  🚛 **Multi-tenant SaaS platforms** - Transport booking systems serving multiple companies
  🗺️ **Geospatial applications** - Real estate management with interactive mapping
  🤖 **AI-powered platforms** - Adaptive learning systems for educational institutions
  📡 **Real-time systems** - WebSocket architectures for live tracking and notifications

  ## Tech Stack
  **Backend:** Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker
  **Frontend:** JavaScript, React, Next.js
  **Infrastructure:** AWS, Docker Compose, Nginx
  **Specialties:** Multi-tenant architecture, PostGIS, Real-time systems, API design

  ## Current Focus
  Building production systems that handle real-world complexity:
  - Circuit breaker patterns for SMS provider failover
  - Multi-tenant database architecture with row-level security
  - Offline authentication for drivers in poor connectivity areas
  - Geospatial search with PostGIS optimization
